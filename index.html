			<h2>Biography</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<h6 class="col-xs-8 col-md-6">With an infectious passion for technology, I have more than ten years of experience in streamlining operations and improving organizational efficiency.</h6>
			</div>
			<p>I have spent my entire adult life creating systems.  I enjoy discovering process improvements and consider well organized structures a thing of pure beauty.  "Work smart" is not just my professional philosophy, this mantra embodies my entire approach to life--period. As such, I've done just that, spending the past three years studying front-end development.  I am very comfortable with technical concepts of varying complexities.  Whatever I don't know, I learn, and have made a habit of doing so as quickly as possible</p>
			<p>Most recently, I spent the past year at Coalition Technologies, a digital marketing firm in Culver City, California.  While there, I learned the ins and outs of SEO, conversion optimization, campaign management, and keyword research to name a few.  While 'learning on the job', I managed campaigns for ten of the agency's largest accounts.</p>
		</div>

			<div class="col-xs-6">
				<p>Prior to Coalition, I was an account manager at Powered Office, a California-based internet startup aimed at empowering small to mid size businesses via website and webapp creation etc., where I managed a portfolio of forty accounts.  Before working on the technical side of things,  I managed their Customer Service department where I implemented new systems and tools via Google Apps, etc.</p>
				<p>To date, via embracing both the creative and quantitative and establishing an authentic rapport with people of diverse backgrounds and standings.  Countless projects and numerous ups-and-downs later, I'm still as obsessed as ever with efficacy and efficiency in employee production and agency acheivement.</p>
				<p>I currently reside in sunny Los Angeles, California and continue to work in tech, both professionally and as a hobby. I have a keen appreciation for good design, which plays a major role in every facet of my life, bordering on obsessive. I also play guitar as a part of a local band, and enjoy physical activities and learning new languages when time allows, both of which are incredibly rewwarding.</p>
